                <h2>SPACECRAFT HAVE VISITED EVERY PLANET</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    We've been exploring space for more than 60 years, and have been 
                    lucky enough to get close-up pictures of dozens of celestial 
                    objects. Most notably, we've sent spacecraft to all of the 
                    planets in our solar system — Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, 
                    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — as well as two dwarf 
                    planets, Pluto and Ceres.
                    <br><br>
                    The bulk of the flybys came from NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2,
                     which left Earth more than four decades ago and are still 
                     transmitting data from interstellar space. Between them, the 
                     Voyagers clocked visits to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and 
                     Neptune, thanks to an opportune alignment of the outer planets.
